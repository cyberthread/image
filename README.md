# Image Practice
This exercise is a basic introduction to using images within your website. For this exercise you'll need to know how to export an imaage and be famililar with the image element in HTML.

In this exercise you will:
- Find an image and export in a specific file format, resolution, aspect ratio and color mode.
- Setup a proper file structure to implement images.
- Practice adding an image to the HTML with alt text.
- Use CSS to keep the image the full width of the container (in this case main) on all screen sizes.

## Tasks
- Choose an image of your own for this assignment. The image needs to be landscape and exported at 1200px wide, JPG, RGB color mode, 16:9 aspect ratio. Remember that the file name should not include spaces (only letters, numbers, hyphen or underscore).
- Create an assets folder in your main directory. Put your image there.
- Add the image to the HTML between the first and second paragraphs. Be sure to include descriptive alt text so that the site visitor will get the same information whether or not they see the image.
- Use CSS to make the image the full width of its parent element (main). You will do this by setting the display type and a width for the image selector.
- Publish your website. Don't forget that you'll need to maintain the same file structure that you have in the main directory in your docs folder.
